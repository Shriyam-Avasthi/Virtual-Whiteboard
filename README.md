# Virtual-Whiteboard
## Description
This repository contains modified files according to what tasks I was told to complete.
## Tasks Completed
1. Added a new screenshot gesture
2. Trained DL model to recognise numbers using Tensorflow
3. (BONUS) Tried to implement data_augmentation (although didn't completely implement it as that required to increase the number of epochs, the remaining time was very less)
4. (BONUS) Implemented taking screenshots of only selected regions using the rectangle tool
